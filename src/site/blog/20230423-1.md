## How to keep using domestic phone number after move overseas

Material list:

- Android phone with demestic sim card installed x1
- Computer which can keep running x1
- Internet access
- Linux cloud server with public IP address x1

Let's get started with sms.

### SMS forward

Using [SmsForwarder](https://github.com/pppscn/SmsForwarder) to forward sms as email. If you are a Wechat user, you can send the mail to QQ mail and receive it in Wechat.

### Calling forward

You can forward phone call using `asterisk`.

Connect your phone to a Linux box which has asterisk installed via bluetooth. Now you can make or answer your call from your own SIP account which is defined in your asterisk box. Install asterisk on the cloud Linux server and then connet 2 asterisk box using `wireguard`. Then config the asterisk box in your home to forward any incoming call to the asterisk box in cloud, and config the asterisk box in cloud to forward any call request to the home one. Now you can login to your asterisk in cloud using any SIP app to make or answer phone call with your phone at home.

> Detailed configuration will be posted later.
